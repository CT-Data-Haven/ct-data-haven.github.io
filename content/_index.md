While [DataHaven](http://www.ctdatahaven.org/) may be best known for our [Community Wellbeing Survey](http://ctdatahaven.org/reports/datahaven-community-wellbeing-survey), our [Community Index reports](http://ctdatahaven.org/reports/greater-new-haven-community-index), or our synthesis of Census data on [communities throughout Connecticut](http://ctdatahaven.org/communities), we also have many smaller side projects. These often sprout from our work in support of other organizations, data from national projects, or just our own interests and curiosities.
